# Solutions in Python

## How to run

```console
python3 solve.py <problem_number> [problem_number ...]
```

The following is an example of execution.

```console
python3 solve.py 1
```

Multiple problems can be specified at the same time.
```console
python3 solve.py 1 2 3 4 5
```

## Notes

These solutions probably work with Python 3.11 or later.
I confirmed to work with Python 3.12.6.
