# Solutions in Python

## How to run

```
$ python3 solve.py <problem_number> [problem_number ...]
```

The following are examples.

```
$ python3 solve.py 1
```

Multiple problems can be specified at the same time.
```
$ python3 solve.py 1 2 3 4 5
```

If data files are required, they will be automatically downloaded. For example, the data file[^1] which is provided by Project Euler is required to run the solution #22.
