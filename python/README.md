# Solutions in Python

## How to run

```console
python3 solve.py <problem_number> [problem_number ...]
```

The following is an example of execution.

```console
python3 solve.py 1
```

Multiple problems can be specified at the same time.
```console
python3 solve.py 1 2 3 4 5
```

If data files are required, they will be automatically downloaded. For example, the data file[^1] which is provided by Project Euler is required to run the solution #22.
```console
python3 solve.py 22
```

## Notes

These solutions should work on Python 3.10 or later.

I use only the standard library and confirmed to work with Python 3.10.7 and 3.11.0.
