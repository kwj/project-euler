# What is this?

I play around with Project Euler to get a feel for programing languages.
This repository deals with only first one-hundred problems based on the rules[^1].

It may help you in solving problems, but it will not help you in programming.

You can use these programs under Unlicense License unless otherwise stated.

I wrote [my impression](https://kwj.github.io/project-euler/) of the first one-hundred problems (only in Japanese for now).
