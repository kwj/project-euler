# Project Euler solutions (the first 100 problems)

## What is this?

I play around with Project Euler to get a feel for programing languages.
This repository deals with only the first 100 problems in accordance with the rule[^1].

I wrote down [my thoughts](./doc/README.md). It might help you understand my programs.

You can use these programs under MIT License unless otherwise stated.
