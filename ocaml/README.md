## How to run

The following are examples of execution.

```

## Notes

The quality of these programs is poor since I'm a newbie of OCaml.

It was confirmed to work with OCaml 5.4.0.
I used the following libraries/packages in addition to the standard libraries part of OCaml.

- Str [^1]
- [Zarith](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/zarith/) 1.14
- [Core](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/core/) v0.17.1

I also used the following package for compilation.

- [Dune](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/dune/) 3.20.2

[^1]: It's distributd with OCaml itself.
