# Solutions in OCaml

## How to run

```

The following are examples of execution.

```console
sh solve.sh 1
```

## Notes

The quality of these programs is poor since I'm a newbie of OCaml.

It was confirmed to work with OCaml 5.1.0.
I used the following libraries/packages in addition to the standard libraries part of OCaml.

- Str [^1]
- Zarith 1.13[^2]
- Core v0.16.1[^3]

I also used the following package for compilation.

- Dune 3.10.0[^4]

[^1]: It's distributd with OCaml itself.
