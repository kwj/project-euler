## My approach

The basic solving algorithm is backtracking.
However, it is inefficient if we generate all possible configurations of numbers from 1 to 9 to fill the empty cells.
Techniques such as narrowing down possible numbers would be necessary to achieve the one-minute rule.

A different solving algorithm is [Exact cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover#Sudoku).

I used both algorithms.
