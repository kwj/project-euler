# Problem 59: XOR Decryption

## The link to the problem

- [XOR Decryption](https://projecteuler.net/problem=59)

## My approach

Since there seems little encrypted data to do frequency analysis,
I think the only way is to create a moderate evaluation function. 
For example, We can be evaluated by frequent words, by type of characters, etc.
