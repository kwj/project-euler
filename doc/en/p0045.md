# Problem 45: Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal

## The link to the problem

- [Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal](https://projecteuler.net/problem=45)

## My approach

All hexagonal numbers are also triangular numbers.

$$
\begin{align}
H_{k} & = k(2k - 1) \\
      & = \frac{(2k - 1)2k}{2} \\
      & = T_{2k-1}
\end{align}
$$

I therefore looked for a hexagonal number that was also a pentagonal number and larger than $H_{143} = 40755$.

## Consideration of improvement

This problem can also be solved using [Pell-type equations](https://imomath.com/index.cgi?page=ntPellsEquationPellType).

$$
\begin{align}
P_{i} & = H_{j} \\
3i^{2} - i & = 4j^{2} - 2j \\
(6i - 1)^{2} - 1 & = 3(4j - 1)^{2} - 3
\end{align}
$$

Let $x = 6i - 1$ and $y = 4j - 1$:
$$x^{2} - 3y^{2} = -2$$

From the above link, $z_{0} = 2 + \sqrt{3}$, thus, $z = 1 + \sqrt{3}$:

$$
x_{n} + y_{n} \sqrt{3} = (1 + \sqrt{3})(2 + \sqrt{3})^{n}, \ \ \ n \in \mathbb{N}
$$

$$
\therefore \begin{pmatrix}
x_{n} \\
y_{n}
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}^{n} \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The answer can be computed from the third $(x_{n}, \ y_{n})$ which
satisfies $x_{n} \equiv 5 \ \text{(mod } 6 \text{)}$ and
$y_{n} \equiv 3 \ \text{(mod } 4 \text{)}$.
