## My approach

This problem is only counting triangles for each condition.

Given that $0 \le x_{1}, \ x_{2}, \ y_{1}, \ y_{2} \le 50$, two points are $P(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $Q(x_{2}, y_{2})$.

#### case #1-1: the right angle is $O(0, 0)$

There are $2500 \ (= 50 \cdot 50)$ triangles becase $P(x_{1}, 0)$ and $Q(0, y_{2})$ where $x_{1} > 0, \ y_{2} > 0$.

#### case #1-2: the right angle $P(x_{1}, 0)$ is on the x-axis

It is clear that $x_{1} > 0$ and $Q(x_{2} = x_{1}, y_{2} > 0)$.
Thus, There are $2500 \ (= 50 \cdot 50)$ triangles.

#### case #1-3: the right angle $Q(0, y_{2})$ is on the y-axis

It is clear that $y_{2} > 0$ and $P(x_{1} > 0, y_{1} = y_{2})$.
Thus, There are $2500 \ (= 50 \cdot 50)$ triangles.

#### case #2-1: $P(x_{1} > 0, y_{1} > 0)$ is the right angle and $Q_{i}(a_{i} > x_{1}, b_{i} < y_{1})$

```
    Y
     | P(x1,y1)
     |   #   Q1(a1,b1)
     |  .       *   Q2(a2,b2)
     | .               *
     |.                       *
    -O------------------------------------- X
                                         *
```

The number of triangles:

$$
\min(\frac{y_{1}}{x_{1} / \gcd(x_{1}, y_{1})}, \ \frac{50 - x_{1}}{y_{1} / \gcd(x_{1}, y_{1})}) 
= \min(\frac{y_{1} \cdot \gcd(x_{1}, y_{1})}{x_{1}}, \ \frac{(50 - x_{1}) \cdot \gcd(x_{1}, y_{1})}{y_{1}}) \quad \text{for } 0 < x_{1} \le 50, \ 0 < y_{1} \le 50
$$

#### case #2-2: $P(x_{1} > 0, y_{1} > 0)$ is the right angle and $Q_{i}(a_{i} < x_{1}, b_{i} > y_{1})$

There are the same number of triangles as in case #2-1.
