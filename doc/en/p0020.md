# Problem 20: Factorial Digit Sum

## The link to the problem

- [Factorial Digit Sum](https://projecteuler.net/problem=20)

## My approach

I think this problem is like the [problem 13](./p0013.md).
It is a practice about large number calculation.

## Note

[Stirling's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation)
is an approximation for factorials.
It can be used to find out the number of digits of $100!$.
