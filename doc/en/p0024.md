## My approach

Since permutations are in lexicographic order,
we can find the answer while dividing by factorials.

For example, the following is how to get the 8*th* lexicographic permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4.

1. Convert position index to 0-origin ($8$ -> $7$). Let the initial digit array is [1, 2, 3, 4].
2. $7 \div 3! = 1$ rem. $1$. The quotient is 1, so the 2nd item of the array is ***2***. Remove it from the array.   
   The new digit array is [1, 3, 4].
3. $1 \div 2! = 0$ rem. $1$. The quotient is 0, so the 1st item of the array is ***1***. Remove it from the array.   
   The new digit array is [3, 4].
4. $1 \div 1! = 1$ rem. $0$. The quotient is 1, so the 2nd item of the array is ***4***. Remove it from the array.   
   The new digit array is [3].
5. $0 \div 0! = 0$ rem. $0$. The quotient is 0, so the 1st item of the array is ***3***. Remove it from the array.   
   The new digit array is [].
6. The answer is ***2143***.
