## My approach

I can think of two naive ways to solve it, but either way, I need to know a range of numbers.

It is clear that 1-digit number is not satisfied the conditions.
We can therefore suppose the lower bound is a 2-digit number $10$.
On the other hand, we can know the upper bound is 6-digit number
because the maximum sum of fifth powers of 7-digit number is $9^{5} * 7 = 413343$
which is smaller than the minimum 7-digit number $1000000$.
As a result, the upper limit is 6-digit number, $9^{5} * 6 = 354294$.

### Method 1

The first method is brute force searching for numbers which are satisfied the conditions
from the range $\lbrack 10, 354294 \rbrack$.

### Method 2

The second method is using combination with repetition.
Create 2- to 6-digit numbers from the numbers 0 through 9,
check the numbers are satisfied the conditions or not.

This method reduces the total number of cases to be checked.
It is a mere 8,000 cases.

$$
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=2}^{6} \left( \\! \\! {10 \choose k} \\! \\! \right) \ \ & = 55 + 220 + 715 + 2002 + 5005 \\
 & = 7997
\end{align}
$$
