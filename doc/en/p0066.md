# Problem 66: Diophantine Equation

## The link to the problem

- [Diophantine Equation](https://projecteuler.net/problem=66)

## My approach

This type of Diophantine Equation is called Pell's equation.
A Pellâ€™s equation has one trivial solution, $(x, y) = (1, 0)$,
however, we need to find a non-trivial minimal solution for this problem.

To find the solution, we can use continued fractions used in the problem 64 and 65.
Please see [the link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation#Fundamental_solution_via_continued_fractions) for detail.
