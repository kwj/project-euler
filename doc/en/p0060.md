# Problem 60: Prime Pair Sets

## My approach

What is the important in this problem is to confirm the answer is the lowest sum.

We can find a set of five primes easily by examining prime numbers up to $10,000$,
and the sum of the set is about $26,000$. Assume that this sum is $X$.
The problem statement mentions the lowest sum for a set of four primes is $792$.
Thus, to verify that $X$ is the lowest sum of a set of five primes,
we must examine primes up to $X - 792$ at least.

Terminating the process when a set of five primes is found is equivalent to
not confirming that the sum of the set is the smallest or not.
This problem is to find the lowest sum of a set of five primes,
not to find the sum of five primes which maximum element is the smallest.

FYI: grouping prime numbers by modulo 3 can reduce the computational complexity.
This is because if we concatenate prime numbers from different groups,
the concatenated number is a multiple of 3.
