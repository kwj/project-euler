# Problem 19: Counting Sundays

## The link to the problem

- [Counting Sundays](https://projecteuler.net/problem=19)

## My approach

It is modulo operation (divisor is 7) since this problem treats day of week. If Sunday is 0, then Monday is 1.

$$
\begin{array}{r|l}
\hline
Date & Day \ of \ week \\
\hline
Jan \ 1, 1900 & 1 \ mod \ 7 = 1 \ (Monday) \\
Jan \ 1, 1901 & (1 + 365) \ mod \ 7 = 2 \ (Tuesday) \\
Feb \ 1, 1901 & (1 + 365 + 31) \ mod \ 7 = 5 \ (Friday) \\
Mar \ 1, 1901 & (1 + 365 + 31 + 28) \ mod \ 7 = 5 \ (Friday) \\
\cdots \ \ & \ \ \cdots \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

In this way, just check each first day of the month through December 2000.

## Other approach

There is an algorithm, [Zeller's congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence),
for calculating the day of week from date.

If the programming language you use provides date library, you can solve the problem using it.
The following is an example in Julia.

```julia
using Dates: dayofweek, Date, Month
length(filter(x -> dayofweek(x) == 7, Date(1901,1,1):Month(1):Date(2000,12,31)))
```
