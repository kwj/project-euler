# Problem 37: Truncatable Primes

## The link to the problem

- [Truncatable Primes](https://projecteuler.net/problem=37)

## My approach

A regular expression for candidates of truncatable prime is `[2357][1379]*[37]`.
I found prime numbers which met the conditions by using the regular expression.
