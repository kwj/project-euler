# Problem 37: Truncatable Primes

## The link to the problem

- [Truncatable Primes](https://projecteuler.net/problem=37)

## My approach

A regular expression for candidates of truncatable prime is `[2357][1379]*[37]`.
I therefore generated numbers that met the regular expression and continued until 11 truncatable primes were found.
