## My approach

It is fast enough even if we solve this problem by brute-force method.
It is useful if we create a cache table for numbers less or equal to 567
because next chains of all numbers under ten million are less or equal to it.

A different approach is to solve using combination of numbers when the upper bound of the number is a power of 10.
For example, we assume that a group of four numbers is {1, 2, 2, 3}.
The 12 numbers presented by the combination are as follows.

```
1223, 1232, 1322, 2123, 2132, 2213, 2231, 2312, 2321, 3122, 3212, 3221
```

The final destination for the above numbers is 89.
In other words, handling with a combination of numbers instead of numerical values reduces the amount of calculation.

Incidentally, a more clever way to solve the problem was found on the thread.
