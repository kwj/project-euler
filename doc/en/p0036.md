# Problem 36: Double-base Palindromes

## The link to the problem

- [Double-base Palindromes](https://projecteuler.net/problem=36)

## My approach

Even numbers can be excluded from the candidates because they aren't palindromic in base $2$.
I solved this problem in a naive way, but it may be faster using property of palindromic number.
