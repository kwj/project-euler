# Problem 70: Totient Permutation

## My approach

It is clear that any prime $p$ is not the answer because $\phi(p) = p - 1$ is not permutation of $p$.

Then, assume that the answer is $N = p_{1}^{k_{1}} \ p_{2}^{k_{2}} \cdots p_{n}^{k_{n}}$
where $p_{i}$ are prime numbers and $k_{i} \in \mathbb{Z} : k_{i} > 0$.

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(N) & = N(1 - 1/p_{1})(1 - 1/p_{2}) \cdots (1 - 1/p_{n}) \\
N / \phi(N) & = \frac{p_{1}}{p_{1} - 1} \ \frac{p_{2}}{p_{2} - 1} \cdots \frac{p_{n}}{p_{n} - 1}
\end{align}
$$

From the problem statement, $\phi(87109) = 79180$ and $87109 = 11 \cdot 7919$

$$
\frac{87109}{\phi(87109)} = 1.100138923 \ldots
$$

$p_{i} \ge 11$ because $7/\phi(7) = 1.1666 \ldots > 87109/\phi(87109)$.
And then, $p_{i} \le (10^7 - 1) / 11$ because $N$ is a product of prime numbers.

The answer $N$ has the following form

$$
N = p_{1}^{k_{1}} p_{2}^{k_{2}} \cdots p_{n}^{k_{n}} \quad (N < 10^7, \ 11 \le p_{1} < p_{2} < \cdots < p_{n} \le (10^7-1)/11, \ \text{$k_1 \geq 2$ when $n=1$})
$$

Therefore, check $N$ from $p_{1} = 3137$ to $11$. This is because it is convenient
to find the smallest $n/\phi(n)$ earlier for pruning which is discussed later.
($3137$ is the largest prime number which is smaller than $\sqrt{10^{7}} = 3162.27 \ldots$)

There are about 1.6 million patterns of $N$ as follows:

```
3137 * 3187
3137 * 3181
3137 * 3169
3137 * 3167
3137 * 3163
3137 * 3137
3121 * 3203
3121 * 3191
3121 * 3187
  ...
13 * 23 * 191
13 * 23 * 181 * 181    # Note: 13 * 23 * 181 * 181 = 9795539 < 10^7
13 * 23 * 181
13 * 23 * 179 * 181    # Note: 13 * 23 * 179 * 181 = 9687301 < 10^7
13 * 23 * 179 * 179
13 * 23 * 179
13 * 23 * 173 * 193    # Note: 13 * 23 * 173 * 193 = 9983311 < 10^7
13 * 23 * 173 * 191
13 * 23 * 173 * 181
13 * 23 * 173 * 179
13 * 23 * 173 * 173
13 * 23 * 173
13 * 23 * 167 * 199    # Note: 13 * 23 * 167 * 199 = 9936667 < 10^7
13 * 23 * 167 * 197
13 * 23 * 167 * 193
  ...
11 * 11 * 11 * 11 * 11 * 13
11 * 11 * 11 * 11 * 11 * 11
11 * 11 * 11 * 11 * 11
11 * 11 * 11 * 11
11 * 11 * 11
11 * 11
```

Check $N$ in the above order, however, we can reduce number of checking patterns when we used current minimum $n/\phi(n)$ as threshold for pruning.
The pruning rules are below.

1. If $p_{1}p_{2}/\phi(p_{1}p_{2})$ is larger than current minimum $n/\phi(n)$, we skip to next smaller $p_{1}$
2. If $p_{1}/\phi(p_{1})$ is larger than current minimum $n/\phi(n)$, we don't search anymore

#### Note

As a result of pruning, only the product of two primes is checked.
However, I couldn't write a program that would check only the product of two primes from the beginning.
This is because that I couldn't know before starting whether the answer was the product of two primes or not.
