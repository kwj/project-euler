# Problem 7: 10001st Prime

## The link to the problem

- [10001st Prime](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

## My approach

I think I have two approaches to this problem.

- Solve naively using primality test function
- Solve using sieve (such Sieve of Eratosthenes)

In the latter case, we usually need an upper bound of 10001st prime to use sieve,
however we can find it from
[the prime number theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#Approximations_for_the_nth_prime_number).


## Note

I think the following method is a kind of sieve, but I don't know what call it is.

```python
def prime_generator():
    prime = 2
    tbl = {}
    while True:
        if prime in tbl:
            for n in tbl[prime]:
                tbl.setdefault(prime + n, []).append(n)
            del tbl[prime]
        else:
            tbl[prime ** 2] = [prime]
            yield prime
        prime += 1
```
