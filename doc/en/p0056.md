# Problem 56: Powerful Digit Sum

## The link to the problem

- [Powerful Digit Sum](https://projecteuler.net/problem=56)

## My approach

I used arbitrary-precision arithmetic to this problem.

It clear that we can omit calculation when $a$ is 1 or a multiple of 10.
Obviously, there are not the answer we seek.
