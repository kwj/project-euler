## My approach

This problem can be solved easily by brute-force.

```python
from math import gcd

def solve_073(limit):
    cnt = 0
    for denom in range(1, limit + 1):
        for numerator in range((denom // 3) + 1, (denom + 1) // 2):
	    if gcd(numerator, denom) == 1:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

print(solve_073(12000))
```

We can also solve the problem by using properties of the Farey sequence.
Here is a sample of backtracking implementation.

```python
def solve_073(limit):
    def dfs(left, right):
        middle = left + right
        if middle > limit:
            return 0
        else:
            return dfs(left, middle) + dfs(middle, right) + 1

    return dfs(3, 2)

print(solve_073(12000))
```

Note: the above Python program fails due to recursion limitations when run with default settings.

There are another ways to solve the problem quickly. You can read the detail in the overview PDF after the correct answer.
The following is an example by using the [Möbius inversion formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_inversion_formula).

$f(n)$ denotes the numbers of fractions such that $x < \dfrac{a}{b} < y, \ x,y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 \le x < y, \ a,b,n \in \mathbb{Z} : 0 < a < b \le n$.
Similarly, $g(n)$ denotes the numbers of irreducible fractions such that $x < \dfrac{a}{b} < y, \ x,y \in \mathbb{R} : 0 \le x < y, \ a,b,n \in \mathbb{Z} : 0 < a < b \le n, \ \gcd(a,b)=1$.

We can write $f(n)$ in terms of $g(n)$.

$$
f(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} g(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor)
$$

By using Möbius inversion formula,

$$
g(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mu(k) f(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor)
$$

where $\mu$ is the [Möbius function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_function).

This problem is to find $g(12000)$ when $x = \dfrac{1}{3}$ and $y = \dfrac{1}{2}$.
We therefore can calculate $g(12000)$ easily by the above equation.
