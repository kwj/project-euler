# Problem 80: Square root digital expansion

## My approach

First I used a method of extracting square root which I was taught in my childhood.
The problem was solved, but it was very tedious.

I therefore solved it by arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

$$
\begin{align}
\large i & \le 10^{99} \sqrt{n} < i + 1 \\
\therefore i^{2} & \le 10^{198} n < (i + 1)^{2}
\end{align}
$$

For example, in the case of $\sqrt{2}$

```python
>>> sum(map(int, list(str(math.isqrt(10**198 * 2)))))
475
```
