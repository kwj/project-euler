## My approach

We can narrow down candidates of $a$ and $b$ before searching.

#### 1) $b$ must be a prime number where $2 < b < 1000$

Suppose $n = 0$, $n^2 + an + b = b$ must be a prime number.
And then, suppose $b=2$, $n^2 + an + b$ is even when $n$ is even.
However, it is inconsistent with $n^2 + an + b$ being a prime number.

#### 2) $a$ must be a odd number

Suppose $n$ is a odd number, $n^2 + b$ must be a even number.
It therefore show $a$ must be a odd number when $n$ is odd.

#### 3) $a + b + 1$ must be a prime number where $0 < a + b + 1 < 2000$

Suppose $n = 1$, $n^2 + an + b = a + b + 1$ must be a prime number.
Let this prime $a + b + 1$ is $x$, so $|a| = |x - b - 1| < 1000$.
Since $2 < b < 1000$, $0 < x = a + b + 1< 2000$.

From the above, the main logic is as follows:

```Python
primes = get_primes(2000)
max_len = 0
max_tpl = (0, 0)    # a, b
for b in filter(lambda x: x < 1000, primes[1:]):    # b = 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., 991, 997
    for a in map(lambda x: x - b - 1, filter(lambda x: abs(x - b - 1) < 1000, primes)):
        if (length := count_consecutive_primes(a, b)) > max_len:
            max_len = length
            max_tpl = (a, b)

print(max_tpl[0] * max_tpl[1])
```
