# Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor

## The link to the problem

- [Largest Prime Factor](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)

## My approach

$600851475143$ is larger than $2^{32}$ but is less than $2^{64}$.
This therefore should not be a problem in modern architectures.

I think this problem is a practice about prime factorization.
If your library doesn't have a function for prime factorization, it should write it for later use.
