# Problem 12: Highly Divisible Triangular Number

## The link to the problem

- [Highly Divisible Triangular Number](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12)

## My approach

Assume the *n*th triangle number is $T_{n}$.

$$
T_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Since $n$ and $n+1$ are coprime, we have the following.

- $\frac{1}{2}n$ and $n+1$ are coprime ($n$ is even)
- $n$ and $\frac{1}{2}(n+1)$ are coprime ($n$ is odd)

Assume that $f(x)$ is the function to find the number of divisors of $x$,
and then $a$ and $b$ are coprime, we have the following.

$$
f(ab) = f(a) \cdot f(b)
$$

The example code would be as follows:

```python
n = 1
while True:
    if num_of_divisors(n) * num_of_divisors((n + 1) // 2) > 500:
        break
    n += 1
    if num_of_divisors(n // 2) * num_of_divisors(n + 1) > 500:
        break
    n += 1

print(n * (n + 1) // 2)
```
