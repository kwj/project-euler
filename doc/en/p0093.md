# Problem 93: Arithmetic Expressions

## The link to the problem

- [Arithmetic Expressions](https://projecteuler.net/problem=93)

## My approach

If possible, we would like to use a system that can handle rational numbers.
If not, it should be implemented to solve this problem even if it is simple functionality.

As for the method of solving, we can use Reverse Polish notation,
or we can use other methods such a brute-force search.
In any case, we just have to look for the answer.
