# Problem 6: Sum Square Difference

## The link to the problem

- [Sum Square Difference](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

## My approach

Since the number is up to 100, it is enough to calculate naively.

We can also solve this problem by formulas for sum.

$$
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k & = \frac{1}{2}n(n+1) \\
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{2} & = \frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)
\end{align}
$$
