## My approach

I think a simplest way to calculate $d(n)$ is to use the [trial division algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division).
However, calculating each $d(n)$ for all $n<10000$ is not fast because the similar process is repeated.

As an alternative, we can use the [divisor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function).
Making the $d(n)$ table for all $n<10000$ using this function is faster than the trial division method
because the function is partially multiplicative.
