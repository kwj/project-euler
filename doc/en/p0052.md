## My approach

Let $x$ is a $n$-digit number.
From the problem statement, $10^{n-1} \le x \le \lfloor (10^{n} - 1) / 6 \rfloor$. 
And then, it shows that the most significant digit of $x$ is $1$.
It also shows the most significant digits of $x, \ 2x, \ 3x, \ 4x, \ 5x$ and $6x$ are all different.
Thus, 'x' is a 6-digit number at least.
