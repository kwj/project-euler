# Problem 84: Monopoly Odds

## The link to the problem

- [Monopoly Odds](https://projecteuler.net/problem=84)

## My approach

It was solved naively using the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).
The cause is unknown, but with 6-sided dice, the results were not consistent.

This problem can also be solved using a Markov chain.
Furthermore, the Julia programming language comes with Linear Algebra library.
We can find the null space of matrix by using this library,
so it can be solved easily without using the Monte Carlo method.
