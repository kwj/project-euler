# Problem 84: Monopoly Odds

## The link to the problem

- [Monopoly Odds](https://projecteuler.net/problem=84)

## My approach

It was solved naively using the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).
The cause is unknown, but with 6-sided dice, the results were not consistent.

By the way, the Julia programming language comes with Linear Algebra library.
We can find the null space of matrix by using this library.
In other words, it can be solved without using the Monte Carlo method.
