## My approach

Think in cases of the starting point and other squares.

The number of starting point is $1$, and the number of upper right corner of *n*th square is $(2n + 1)^{2} \ \ (n \ge 1)$.
Let $f(n)$ is the sum of the four corners of *n*th square:

$$
\begin{align}
f(n) & = (2n + 1)^{2} + ((2n + 1)^{2} - 2n) + ((2n + 1)^{2} - 4n) + ((2n + 1)^{2} - 6n) \\
     & = 16n^{2} + 4n + 4
\end{align}
$$

And then, a square $1001$ by $1001$ is the $(1001 - 1) / 2 =$ *500*th square.

From the above, let $S$ is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a $1001$ by $1001$ spiral:

$$
\begin{align}
S & = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{500} f(n) \\
  & = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{500} (16n^{2} + 4n + 4)
\end{align}
$$

We can calculate naively or using formulas for sum which are mentioned at the [Problem 6](./p0006.md).
