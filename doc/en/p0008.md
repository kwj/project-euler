# Problem 8: Largest Product in a Series

## The link to the problem

- [Largest Product in a Series](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8)

## My approach

There is nothing particularly difficult about this problem.
Since the answer is the largest product of adjacent 13 digits,
split the 1000-digit number by 0 as a separator may reduce the amount of calculation.
