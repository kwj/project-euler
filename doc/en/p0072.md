# Problem 72: Counting Fractions

## The link to the problem

- [Counting Fractions](https://projecteuler.net/problem=72)

## My approach

The number of irreducible fraction with denominator $d$ is equal to the Euler's totient function $\phi(d)$.
In other words, this problem is equivalent to calculate $\displaystyle \large \sum_{n=2}^{10^6} \phi(n)$.

We can solve this problem by brute-force.
Furthermore, the totient function is a multiplicative function, which reduces the computational complexity.

Incidentally, there is a quite different solution to this problem.
It is using properties of sum of the Euler's totient function 
(link [#1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/316376/how-to-calculate-these-totient-summation-sums-efficiently),
[#2](https://mathproblems123.wordpress.com/2018/05/10/sum-of-the-euler-totient-function/)).
If we use memoization, it would be more faster.
