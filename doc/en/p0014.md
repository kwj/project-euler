# Problem 14: Longest Collatz Sequence

## The link to the problem

- [Longest Collatz Sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)

## My approach

It is clear that it's not necessary to start to check length of Collatz sequence from numbers less than 500,000
because the next term of even number $n$ in Collatz sequence is $n/2$.

If possible, use memoization in the solution.
