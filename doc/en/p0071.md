# Problem 71: Ordered Fractions

## The link to the problem

- [Ordered Fractions](https://projecteuler.net/problem=71)

## My approach

The sequence of fractions mentioned in the problem statement is called the Farey sequence.

We can solve the problem by brute-force, however, it is easy to solve
by using [properties of the Farey sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence#Farey_neighbours).
